So I want to set up a blog framework. Now, I'd love to make the whole thing but real talk that's going to eat time. I want a project I can finish a little quicker, and used to practice subskills. Namely, I want to focus on my styling and using TypeScript this time around. So here's my plan:

1. use an existing blog package to set up the backend.
2. install React on top.
3. install typescript.
4. style my own custom theme with React and TypeScript.
5. use typescript to fully set up the blog package.
6. make sure we can post, edit, and delete.
7. push to heroku/github pages.
