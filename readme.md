# Fi.do About Card (Paused)
This is another full tech stack site I was building, with a Node backend, but it was an attempt to further practice Bootstrap and UI design. I ultimately decided to pause it to pivot towards getting into more computer science fundamentals - the project was spinning off from what I had originally intended. As a training exercise, it was still useful. I intend to return to this down the line to polish things up. As it stands, it needs more work to make things truly responsive. There's a Node backend and a React frontend, but they're not connected. You can still check out the React frontend, however, to see the design.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/MHWillard/about-card.git
```

2. Install npm packages.
``` sh
npm install
```

3. Navigate to the client folder and type 'npm start' to run the frontend.

## Usage
This is a starting point for a basic social media frontend with event handlers that track which component is active. From here, it can be improved in terms of a responsive web design and connecting to a backend with CRUD operations.
